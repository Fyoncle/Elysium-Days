## 1. Unintended Animated Eyes Glitch
If your skin's eyes appear broken (even though you didn’t intentionally enable face animations), it’s likely due to unintended pixels on the head part of your skin. Here's an example:

These black lines are incorrect. Ensure that all sides of the face (head and second layer) are **8x8 pixels**.

## 2. Game Crashes
If your game crashes either open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fyoncle/Elysium-Days/issues), or join the [Elysium Days Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WFpDr7zY8Z) and share your log by uploading it to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs).

## 3. Errors on Screen While Joining a Server
![Weird Text Example](https://github.com/Fyoncle/Elysium-Days/assets/63975256/5057177c-9a56-43e5-a4d0-ab292a237842)

This happens when the server is using a different version of Elysium Days than your client. Ensure you’re using the same version as the server.

## 4. Floating Blocks & Pink Beds in Servers
This issue occurs if you try to join a vanilla server with a modded client without installing Fabric. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg91I4vg7ew) to **properly** set up a Fabric server.

## 5. Broken Fonts
![Broken Fonts Example](https://github.com/Fyoncle/Elysium-Days/assets/63975256/80f0d98e-1a72-471d-ab50-e4abee500b01)  

Broken fonts are usually caused by insufficient allocated RAM. Elysium Days requires **at least** 5 GB of RAM, and 6 GB recommended. If any less is allocated, the game won’t load properly.
Refer to [this guide](https://moddedmc.wiki/en/project/elysium-days/docs/guides/memory_allocation) to learn how to allocate more RAM.

## 6. Nether Plains Biome Issue
If you see **Plains biomes above Y 256 in the Nether**, it means your world was created before **ED 4.2.0**, which introduced breaking changes.  
To fix this:  
1. Update to the latest release of Elysium Days.  
2. Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/Z0cHV8PHKFU?t=70) to delete your Nether files.  
3. Re-enter the portal to regenerate the Nether.
