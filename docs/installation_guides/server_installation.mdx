---

To set up Elysium Days for a server, or an unsupported launcher, simply:

1. Download the [latest release](https://modrinth.com/modpack/elysium-days/versions) of the modpack.
2. Visit [.mrpack to Zip](https://jamie.codeberg.page/mrpack-to-zip/@master/) and upload the `.mrpack` file you downloaded.
3. Click **Download**, and you'll get the modpack files as a `.zip`.
4. Excluding `resourcepacks` and `shaderpacks` folder, drop mods and configs in your server.
5. That's it!

    If you're using a hosting that already supports modpacks, and specifically Elysium Days, only searching it and clicking Install will do the job.
