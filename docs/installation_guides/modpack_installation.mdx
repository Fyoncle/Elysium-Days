## General Installation
If you're using a launcher that supports Elysium Days like Modrinth, Prism. Just search for the modpack's name directly in the launcher on the Modrinth section.

<Callout variant="info">
    If your launcher, including CurseForge, doesn't support Elysium Days, refer to [this section](https://moddedmc.wiki/tr/project/elysium-days/docs/installation_guides/server_installation) of the wiki.
