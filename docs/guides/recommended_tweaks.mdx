## 1. Accesibility Settings
If you felt like the game was missing something, it's because by default I disabled View Bobbing (That one is in video settings), Damage Tilt, Distortion Effects, and FOV Effects for people who has motion sickness, if you want to enable them back you can visit Options > Accesibility Settings

## 2. Java Choice
Not every Java is same if you didn't know, some Javas performing way worse in Elysium Days than others, my personal suggestion would be using [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=17&os=any&arch=any), when you enter this page choose your OS and install the JRE one. After installing, you can choose Adoptium in your Launcher's Java and Memory settings.
