## Method 1: Buying a Server Hosting

With this method, you will have to choose a hosting and buy a server with a decent amount of specs. Here is some options:

- **[Exaroton](https://exaroton.com)**: If you're only using it at times and not so often, Exaroton provides the best value in this case since it uses credits instead of monthly payment that only gets consumed when you use the server. Server also goes offline when no one is playing, and launches again when someone tries to connect.
- **[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/servers)**: If you have a friend group that is ALWAYS active and you will be using the server a lot, then Modrinth definitely provides better value per month.

    I am **NOT** sponsored by any servers that I have listed there as options, they are my personal opinion according to my researches. For more alternatives please see this [docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZE7Pi6FPEhbN-JQtXKX69Udp6dA5OBOu4Kpdzz53MI/edit?usp=sharing) or this [video](https://youtu.be/gNMBYhEuDv8) by CygnusMC.

#### ✅ Pros
- You will have an easy to use interface to control your server.
- Your server will be 24/7 (unless stated otherwise in the hosting's website.)

#### ❌ Cons
- Can get too expensive for a small friend group in the long-run.

## Method 2: Hosting a Server from Your PC

If you prefer to host a server on your own computer, check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg91I4vg7ew) for step-by-step instructions.

<Callout variant="info">
    You will need to refer to the [server installation guide](https://moddedmc.wiki/tr/project/elysium-days/docs/installation_guides/server_installation) in the wiki for the required server files.

<Callout variant="warning">
    If you're in the CGNAT pool, then you can’t port forward to use this method to play with people that is not connected to your network.
</Callout>

#### ✅ Pros
- You don't have to pay for a hosting.
- You will store your files locally.

#### ❌ Cons
- You will have to learn how to port forward.
- Your server will be shut down if your PC is closed.
- If you can't leave your PC open always, then this solution won't provide 24/7 servers.
  - You can buy a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to avoid this though.

## Method 3: Using the Cloudflared Mod (Built-in Elysium Days)

This method allows you to host a server without port forwarding. Simply:

1. Open the **ESC menu** in Minecraft.  
2. Click **"Open to LAN"** to start the server.  
3. A Cloudflare tunnel IP address will be displayed in the chat, share the IP with your friends for them to join!

---

#### ✅ Pros
- Safer than Essential. Also has very minimal lag.
- No need for server specific configuration makes it easier to use.
- No port forwarding required.

#### ❌ Cons
- The IP changes every time you open to LAN.
- Server shuts down when you leave the world, meaning it's not 24/7.
- Requires everyone to have an original Minecraft account.
  - Can be avoided by using [LAN Server Properties](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lan-server-properties) and setting it to Offline Mode + UUID Fix.
